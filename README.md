# WAR Card Game

A Python implementation of the classic two-player card game **War**, developed as a high-school project to demonstrate foundational programming concepts, game logic, and object-oriented design.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates the traditional card game **War**, where two players compete using a standard 52-card deck. Each round, players reveal the top card of their deck; the higher-ranked card wins the round and collects both cards. In the event of a tie, a **war** occurs, introducing additional game logic to resolve the round.

The game continues until one player collects all cards or the simulation reaches a defined stopping condition.

This project prioritizes **clarity, correctness, and learning value** over advanced graphics or UI.
